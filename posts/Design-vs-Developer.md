Over the past 6 weeks I have been working everyday to build on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. After spending much time focusing on the fundamentals of those three languages I have since moved onto learning React which has served to hone my skills in the three basic languages. In this process I found myself consistently letting the worries of "how something looks", or not liking the layout of how a project came out while I try to showcase my skill.

With some consultation I have come to realize that I am actually hindering my ability as a junior developer because I am technically worrying about a skillset that I do not possess. This is where it becomes important to understand the difference between a developer, and a designer. For my case, 95% of the projects I work on through my study are solo-projects. The objective of the solo-projects is to showcase functionality with passable UI. This shift in thinking should serve as a basis when completing projects in the future and contextualize what is important right now for my growth as a developer. To be a developer is to understand that your career is going to require constant learning and re-learning, and understanding the differences between those two very important roles will provide a good framework for how you go about showcasing your newly learned knowledge. 

I cannot stress enough how simple this may seem but it is very important for anyone who is looking to break into the software development field to understand the distinction.
