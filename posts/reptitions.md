Repetitions in coding is the most important aspect of becoming a better programmer. As someone who is working to continue my career as a software developer the shift between conventional learning in school/university is fundamentally different than how I learn how to code.

The closest equivalent I can find between conventional learning and learning to code is a cross between learning a new language and math.
In math (aside from theoretical math and other more advanced mathematics) there are concrete rules for how functions and equations work. You either get the correct result, or you don't. I never was good at math for this reason, for me to learn I need to know why something works, I need to know who discovered it and how something works. For me this is how I can make connections and learn because I find that learning this way leads to very logical conclusions that I can remember and understand.

Coding, like math, is similar; you either get the correct result or you don't. Further like math, when you're understanding the rules and functions and you consistently get arithmetic(coding) correct your confidence feels high. The problem lies when you're not getting the result you're looking for. This is where repetition comes in.

When learning coding, the repetitions of learning syntax and semantics, not only helps with retention but it also helps in the ability to look for solutions. Most cases in conventional learning there is textbooks, journals, articles, excerpts, etc where you can find what you're looking for and it is written in understandable english. In coding, you have to know the jargon and be able to cleanly express what you're looking for to get the proper help and results you are looking for. The more you build your foundational knowledge and understand the programming logic and language, the more the ability to look for solutions gets easier, the more information retention gets easier and the time between tasks can potentially get shorter.
